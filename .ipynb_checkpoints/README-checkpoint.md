# Machine Learning Fundamentals Repository
Here are three practice datasets and three practice problems for: linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), naive bayes, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). 

I used Chat GPT to generate practice datasets and problems for me to optimize my study and practice of ML methods and tools.

- [Salary Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/karthickveerakumar/salary-data-simple-linear-regression): A dataset with years of experience and corresponding salary data.

### Practice Problems

1. Predicting house prices based on features using linear regression.
2. Predicting sales based on advertising budget using linear regression.
3. Predicting salary based on years of experience using linear regression.

To get started with linear regression, clone this repository and explore the Jupyter notebooks available in the [Linear Regression](/Notebooks/Linear_Regression) directory. Each notebook provides detailed explanations, code examples, and visualizations to guide you through the implementation and analysis.

- [Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci): A dataset with various features related to heart disease diagnosis.
- [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html): A dataset containing features computed from breast cancer cell images.

### Practice Problems

1. Predicting survival on the Titanic based on passenger information using logistic regression.
2. Predicting heart disease diagnosis based on various features using logistic regression.
3. Classifying breast cancer as malignant or benign based on cell image features using logistic regression.

To get started with logistic regression, clone this repository and explore the Jupyter notebooks available in the [Logistic Regression](/Notebooks/Logistic_Regression) directory. Each notebook provides detailed explanations, code examples, and visualizations to guide you through the implementation and analysis.
